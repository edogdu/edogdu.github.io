## Ongoing Research Support


R01-HL123762, NIH/NHLBI, [Lindner](https://www.ohsu.edu/people/jonathanlindner/46a15e53d09f45ee9ce4da620c3dd61a) (PI), Co-Investigator 

*Augmentation of Tissue Perfusion in PAD with Ultrasound-mediated
Cavitation*

> The major goal of this project is to explore how ultrasound-mediated
cavitation of microbubble contrast agents can produce augmentation in
tissue perfusion, and to assess the mechanism by which flow increases.


R01 HL136373-01A1, NIH/NHLBI, [Pamir](http://www.ohsu.edu/blogs/researchnews/2016/07/14/whos-new-at-ohsu-nathalie-pamir-ph-d/) (PI), Co-Investigator

*Identification of the role of HDL function in human cardiovascular disease and stroke through proteomics and genetics*

> This project aims to study the cardiovascular risk prediction ability of HDL's cholesterol efflux function compared 
to HDL cholesterol levels in stroke patients from a bi-racial cohort, REGARDS.

----, Department of Veterans Affairs MVP, [Luoh](https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/shiuhwen-luoh/3781760CCD9941D69B4E81AD6D846364) (PI), Co-Investigator

*Predicting the Breast Cancer Risk for Women Veterans*

> The goal of this proposal is to extract SNP information from the Million Veteran Program data and 
together with demographic, life style, family history, and other information obtained from the MVP and 
clinical data, to build a breast cancer risk prediction model that can be applied to women veterans enrolled in the MVP.

17GRNT33670428,  AHA, [Tereshchenko](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/heart-vascular/research-training/research-programs/tereshchenko.cfm) (PI), Co-Investigator

*Global electrical heterogeneity and clinical outcomes*

>The goal of this proposal is to validate global electrical heterogeneity sudden cardiac 
death risk score in OHSU health care population.


17GRNT33670334,  AHA, [Broberg](https://www.ohsu.edu/people/craig-s-broberg/56706C6FED3A40D18AAB203D872671EE) (PI), Co-Investigator

*The Systemic Right Ventricle: Risks and Outcomes of Congestive Heart Failure*

>The goal of this project is see the risks and Outcomes of Congestive Heart 
Failure in patients with a Systemic Right Ventricle.

R21-NS094833-01, DHHS/NIH/IGNITE, [Stenzel-Poore](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/molecular-microbiology-and-immunology/labs/stenzel-poore-lab/index.cfm) (PI), Biostatistician

*Development of Poly ICLC for neuroprotection against ischemic brain
injury*

>This proposal seeks to advance PolyICLC, a compound that has shown
efficacy as a prophylactic treatment in mice, through our novel nonhuman
primate stroke model, allowing for eventual translation into patients at
risk of brain ischemic injury.

P30 CA69533-19, NIH/NCI, [Druker](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/cancer/about-us/druker/) (PI), Faculty

*OHSU Knight Cancer Institute*

>To support the Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University,
its programs, shared resources, and administration. Shared resources
include; cancer pathology, flow cytometry, molecular biology,
transgenic/gene knockout, gene array, clinical research management,
biostatistics and informatics. The instruments of the Institute foster
interdisciplinary coordination and collaboration of cancer research
faculty at OHSU in basic, clinical, and population research.

*Biomarker assessment for identifying heightened risk for cardiovascular
complications during long-duration space missions*

>With the proposed work we will explore new paradigms for: (a) predicting
risk for developing atherosclerotic complications in astronauts, (b)
monitoring in-flight changes in risk profile that may occur in the
setting of deep space exploration, and (c) identifying endothelial
susceptibility to the detrimental effects of space radiation. I oversee
data collection and processing, coordinate with other statisticians and
bioinformaticians on managing the data and performing statistical
analyses.


U01 CA185094, NIH/NCI, [Peters](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/profiles/peters-ulrike.html) (PI), Site PI

*Colorectal Tumor Risk Prediction in the PLCO Trial*

>The study will use detailed risk-factor information for colorectal
cancer (CRC), including genome-wide genetic data as well as lifestyle
and environmental risk factors, to build and validate a comprehensive
risk-prediction model using data from a large CRC consortium and the
PLCO trial as an independent validation study. As Co-I, I participate in
the development of the models and the statistical advisory of the study.
