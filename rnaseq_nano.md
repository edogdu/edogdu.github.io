## Hands-On Introduction to RNA-seq [(Flyer)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TIlTNZqT1JiSvp6vIR-an0FiJwlpM1Kr).

This was a "nano-course" offered at OHSU in February 2017 to introduce cell and molecular biology graduate students to RNA-seq data generation and analyses. 
We combined lectures with hands-on activities. Julja Burchard, Dr. Alex Nechiporuk, and Dr Arie Baratt were co-instructors. I presented on experimental design and analysis 
considerations. You can see my slides below.

## Topic: use of RNAseq for biomedical discovery 

- Data generation: RNA QA; library preparation; sequencing
- Data processing: alignment, genome annotation, junctions 
- Data analysis: normalization, differential expression, pathway analysis
- Experimental design: sample size, depth of coverage, confounders
