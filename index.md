I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Oregon Health & Sciences University. I am
a faculty member of the [OHSU-PSU School of Public Health](http://ohsu-psu-sph.org/) with appointments in the Knight
Cardiovascular Institute and Knight Cancer Institute Biostatistics Shared Resource.
My statistical research interests include risk prediction with high dimensional data sets and the
analysis of genetic and other omics data.

I teach Mathematics/Statistics II, a statistical inference course for the [MS in Biostatistics program](http://ohsu-psu-sph.org/index.php/ms-in-biostatistics/)
at OHSU-PSU School of Public Health.
